            <h2>What is Jira?</h2>
            <p>
              Jira is an extensively utilized issue tracking and project
              management software developed by Atlassian. It provides teams with
              a comprehensive and customizable platform to plan, track, and
              release software projects seamlessly.

            <h2>Jira in Action</h2>
            <p>Let's take a closer look at how Jira works in practice.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                You can create different issue types such as tasks, user
                stories, or bugs in Jira.
              </li>
              <li>
                Assign these issues to team members, set due dates, and track
                their progress.
              </li>
              <li>
                Use agile boards to visualize and manage the flow of work. For
                example, you can use Scrum boards to plan sprints and track the
                team's progress.
              </li>
            </ul>
